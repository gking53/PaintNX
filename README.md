# PaintNX

A Nintendo Switch Homebrew for painting. Made in C as a side project when I was bored in school. Can do as many colors as you can see on the screen. 720p screen resolution and WIP jpeg loading for drawing on top of other images. To save the image you have draw, use the screenshot button on the controller :) Still needs work on memory bugs due to malloc, will be removing as many as possible soon.
